Files :- File is a collection of data is available to a program.
        We can retrieve and use data stored in a file whenever we required.
Advantages :- 1. stored data is permanent unless someone remove it.
              2. stored data can be shared.

Types of files :- 
1. Text File
2. Binary File

Text mode
-> a file opened in text mode, treats its contents as if it contains text string of the str type.
-> when you get data from a text mode file. python first encodes the raw bytes using either a platform dependent encoding or specified one.

Binary mode
-> A file opened


Opening a file :- 

If we want to use a file or its data first we have to open it.

1.open() - open() function is used to open a file. It returns a pointer to the beginning of the file. This is called file handler or file object.
Syntax :- 
    open('filename',mode='r',buffering,encoding=None,errors=None,newline=None,closefd=True,opener=None)

filename -> it represents a name of a file.
mode -> it represents the purpose of opening the file. If defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text mode.
buffering -> It is an integer value used to set the size of the buffer for the file. We can pass 0 as buffering integer to inform to inform not to use any buffering.
We can pass any positive integer.
Default is 4096 or 8192 bytes.

text file mode

r - open for reading
w - open for write
x - open for exclusive with write. specified file must not be available.File is available it will show error fileexists error
a - open for appending
r+ - open for reading and then writing
