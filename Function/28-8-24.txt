       -> A module is a file containing group of variables,methods,functions and classes etc.
       -> They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement.
       -> The file name is the module name with the suffix.py appended
       Ex:-  mymodule.py

       Types of module :- 
       1. User-defined modules
       2. Built-in modules
            Ex:- array,math,numpy,sys
            
    
    When and why use the module 
    Assume that you are building a very large project.it will difficult to manage all logic within one single file so if you want to seperate your similar logic to a seperate file, you can use module.
    It will not only seperate your logics but also help you to debug your code easily as you know which logic is defined in which module.
    When a module is developed, it can be reused in any program that needs that module.


    Creating a Module
    mathoperation.py
    def add(a,b):
        return a+b
    def sub(a,b):
        return a-b
